### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a ~~full~~ omni-stack weatherstation (i.e. from building the infrastructure for letting the electrons flow up to weather forecasts and action recommendations upon them)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning zig
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on shogi and stockfish
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with voron
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about cryptography, dotnet, GnuPG, k8s, OpenTofu
- âš¡ Fun fact: Imagine a software museum - a place where ancient code artifacts are preserved. In one wing, you'll find the fossilized remains of proprietary software, encased in amber. In the next room, open-source exhibits thrive, humming with community spirit. My professional endeavors, shrouded in the clandestine folds of closed-source intellectual property, remain hidden from the world. A paradox unfolds - a lifetime dedicated to work that swells with pride, yet yields naught tangible to display.
